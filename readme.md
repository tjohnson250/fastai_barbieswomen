A dataset and Jupyter notebook for exploring Lesson 1 of the Fast.ai Deep Learning 1 course using barbies vs. women, instead of the original Kaggle Dogs and Cats dataset.

@semih suggested classifying photos of barbies vs. women: http://forums.fast.ai/t/wiki-lesson-1/9398/

barbieswomen.zip contains training and validation data set up using the folder structure required for fast.ai. I created the dataset using two python scripts:

googleimagesdownload: https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download

You can install this using `pip install google-images-download`

make_train_valid.py from https://github.com/prairie-guy/ai_utilities

`googleimagesdownload` requires a machine with a chrome browser and the appropriate chromedriver (see the googleimagesdownload GitHub repo for instructions). Otherwise, you are limited to 100 images.

Download the images using these commands. 

```
googleimagesdownload -k "woman" -o "barbieswomen" --format jpg --usage_rights labeled-for-reuse -l 150 --chromedriver ./chromedriver
googleimagesdownload -k "barbie" -o "barbieswomen" --format jpg --usage_rights labeled-for-reuse -l 150 --chromedriver ./chromedriver
```

Examine the images and remove incorrect images. I removed all paintings and images that were not clearly women or barbies. I also removed images that contained both women and barbies, since the model is forced to choose between one or the other classification.

Use imagemagick to resize images for easier uploading and processing:

```
cd women
convert -resize '640' *.jpg woman.jpg
```
You will now see your original files and new files titled `woman-n.jpg` in the same directory. If you are happy with the resizing delete, the originals and convert the other directory of images.

If you are sure the resize is exactly as you need, you can also use mogrify instead of convert to resize and replace your originals:

```
mogrify -resize '640' *.jpg woman.jpg
```

Make the train and valid datasets/directory structure:

```
make_train_valid.py barbieswomen --train .80 --valid .20
```

Now compress the directory and upload to your VM.
If using Paperspace through SSH, execute:

```
scp barbieswomen.zip paperspace@<your machine's public IP address>:./barbieswomen.zip
```
